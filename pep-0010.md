## Abstract

The SDR model is one of the most widely applied InVEST models (Mandle and
Natural Capital Project, 2021). Yet, it comes with a number of
assumptions and creates a number of output indicators  that are deprecated,
poorly documented, and do not meet the current needs. This has also
led to a rising number of user forum inquiries about the
functioning of the model and how to interpret the resulting
indicators. This PEP results from an in-depth review of model
assumptions done by a group of expert NatCap users, scientists, and
software engineers, and aims at streamlining the SDR model by (1)
revising some indicators to reflect the conceptual understanding of the
science team about model processes, based on the current
state-of-science and (2) reducing the number of indicators to those
which are most useful to current users.

## Motivation

Two of the most widely appreciated benefits of sediment retention by vegetation
are 1) improved water quality from avoided sediment export from hillslopes to
waterways, and 2) maintenance of soil fertility from avoided topsoil erosion.
The current SDR model lacks indicators that clearly and comprehensively
represent these services, despite the demand for such indicators both in NatCap
applications and from users on our forum. This PEP would  introduce two new
sediment retention indicators that more comprehensively capture the ecosystem
service being provided, one from the perspective of water quality and one from
the perspective of soil fertility. In the case of sediment retention for water
quality, we propose an indicator for sediment retention services for water
quality that captures the ability of vegetation to both keep sediment from
eroding and to trap sediment originating upslope. We also propose dropping
several current model outputs that do not address the service as directly and
are either (1) deprecated (were kept in the model at some point to ensure
backward compatibility), or (2) could be calculated by users
with a scenario approach (e.g., ask the user to run a “bare-soil” scenario,
rather than having it predetermined/fixed in the code), or (3)
do not fully represent what the PEP authors agreed that they should be
representing. These could still be calculated if desired from
intermediate outputs or by running an additional scenario.

This proposal would additionally alter the current calculation of the
deposition and flux indicators that track trapping of sediment that
erodes onto a pixel in order to make them more consistent with the
conceptual processes the SDR model represents. Beyond those code
updates, this PEP would also  update the User Guide to harmonize
terminology and improve clarity for users (including some new
visualizations and description of use cases).

We thus propose that these revisions of SDR are better tackled through
a PEP (and joint effort of the science team), rather than a piece-meal
approach to solving individual problems with indicators and the User
Guide in response to user/staff requests.


The revised SDR model seems to be highly aligned with the general PEP
guidelines:

* Actionable: The SDR model has been shown to be relevant to many different
  stakeholders, decision problems, and scales
* Generalizable: The tool has been run from hyper-local case studies to global
  scales
* Innovation: The revised model will produce new indicators which, based on our
  own experiences and questions received on the User Forum, will be very useful
  for decision support (e.g., Retention indicator) and that a normal user could
  not easily calculate. The new indicators will further respond to issues that
  have been repeatedly raised in the User Forum.
* Credibility:
  * The proposed changes have been vetted by the science and software team, and
    seem to be more aligned with the model's intention (e.g., as described in
    the User Guide).
  * Similar to current SDR, the revised indicators we propose are mostly
    conceptual and hard to validate. Yet, the revised indicators are more aligned
    with the intention of what is described in the User Guide, avoid violating
    sediment mass balances (e.g. that more sediment is retained than what is
    eroded) and allow users to track sediment mass balance through the model in
    a way that was not possible before.
* Generalizability: as per above, the model has been shown to be useful in many
  settings and decision contexts.
* Feasibility: Calculation of all indicators will be possible within the
  existing model framework ([James has already implemented these changes in a
  fork of InVEST](https://github.com/natcap/invest/compare/main...phargogh:task/sdr-retreat-2022-03-22-rework-downslope-deposition-equations)).

Additional criteria that might be relevant

* Demonstrated interest: There are many threads on the forum where users ask
  for clarification regarding existing indicators
* Novelty: The proposed changes will make the model more consistent compared to
  what we have and will produce indicators that are otherwise hard to obtain by
  users from “raw” SDR outputs.
* Maintenance: The models will be maintained as part of InVEST, just like
  previous versions of SDR.  Usability: SDR has been proven to be usable across
  scales, geographies, and decision making contexts.

## Support

No additional support is needed beyond what is done for InVEST. Some additional
help might be required for forum users inquiring about changes, although we
expect this to be offset by the reduction in time required to respond to forum
posts asking for clarification on the current set of model outputs/indicators.

## Specification

This PEP proposes the following changes, which we outline here and specify in
more detail below:

1. **Update the calculation of intermediate parameters R (deposition) and F (flux).**
   Currently R and F are calculated such that sediment that erodes from a pixel
   (as calculated by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation or RUSLE) can
   then be trapped by vegetation on that same pixel. This is conceptually
   inconsistent: the role of vegetation for reducing erosion and sediment
   runoff from a pixel is already captured in RUSLE’s C factor (Wischmeier and
   Smith, 1978). By allowing for immediate sediment trapping on
   the same pixel, this amounts to double-counting the role of vegetation. We
   propose updating the calculation so that all sediment that erodes from a
   pixel goes to the next downslope pixel in proportion to the proportion of
   water flowing into the next downslope pixel, where it can either be trapped
   or continue flowing downslope. This change will not affect estimates of
   water quality for any given scenario relative to the current formulation of
   the model; it will lead to some change in the attribution of where sediment
   retention services are being provided on the landscape.  Rename the
   indicator “R” (which is also used in the USLE equation) to “T” for “trapped
   sediment”, or “trapping”.
2. **Create a new output and indicator for sediment retention services for
   water quality called "Avoided Export".**
   The raster output represents vegetation’s contribution to both avoided
   erosion from a pixel and trapping of sediments originating on upslope
   pixels, e.g., the service of a pixel from the perspective of downstream
   water user.
3. **Create a new output and indicator for sediment retention services for soil
   fertility called "Avoided Erosion".**
   This raster output represents avoided erosion benefits to that pixel, e.g.,
   from the perspective of maintaining soil fertility.
4. **Drop 2 legacy sediment retention indices currently included in the model.**
   One of the frequently asked questions on the User Forum is what metric
   people should use for the sediment retention “service”, and we have not
   historically had a solid answer, because neither of the “retention” outputs
   are very useful. They are indices only (not quantities), compared against a
   hypothetical entirely barren landscape (which is unrealistic), and one of
   the indices has no explanation at all given in the User Guide, so no current
   NatCapper actually knows what it means. Removing these, and adding clear
   guidance about calculating retention to the User Guide (see #5) would
   significantly reduce confusion.
5. **Updates to the User's Guide**
   to reflect the above changes, harmonize terminology and variable names and
   provide a conceptual figure for visualizing the modeling steps and related
   outputs. We will also more clearly explain what’s happening in the different
   modeling steps and present options and use cases for quantifying the
   retention “service” from model outputs, informed by common questions on the
   User Forum.

The required technical changes to address those 5 points are detailed below:

1. **Update the calculation of the intermediate parameters R (deposition) and F (flux).**
   * Update the $$ R $$ (deposition) calculation so that it does not include export
     from pixel i. Basically removing the $$ E_i’ $$ from the equation below so that a
     pixel cannot retain the sediment that erodes directly from itself (note:
     equation numbers are matched to the User Guide). Thus from

     $$ R_i = dR_i \cdot \left(\sum_{j \in {pixels\ that\ drain\ to\ i}}F_j \cdot p(i,j)\right) + E_i' $$

     Revise to

     $$ R_i = dR_i \cdot \left(\sum_{j \in {pixels\ that\ drain\ to\ i}}F_j \cdot p(i,j)\right) $$

     Rename the indicator from “R” (which is used in the USLE equation) to “T”
     for “trapped sediment”, or “trapping”.

   * Update $$ F $$ (flux) calculation so that all export/erosion originating from
     that pixel goes on to the next downslope pixel or pixels (rather than just
     a fraction). Thus from

     $$ F_i = (1 - dR_i) \cdot \left(\sum_{j \in {pixels\ that\ drain\ to\ i}}F_j \cdot p(i,j)\right) + E_i' $$

     Revise to

     $$ F_i = (1 - dR_i) \cdot \left(\sum_{j \in {pixels\ that\ drain\ to\ i}}F_j \cdot p(i,j)\right) $$

     In addition, we would rename variable $$ R $$ (deposition) to $$ T $$ (for
     sediment trapping), to avoid confusion with the $$ R $$ variable
     name already used previously in the calculation of the  $$ RUSLE $$, and update
     variable names in the User Guide for consistency and clarity.
2. **Create new ecosystem service indicator output (raster) called “ Avoided Export”**
   representing vegetation’s contribution to avoided erosion from a pixel and
   trapping of sediments originating upslope (the service from the perspective
   of a water user):

   $$ TR_i = (RKLS_i - USLE_i) \cdot SDR_ + R_i $$

   Where:
     * $$ TR_i $$ is Total Retention
     * $$ RKLS $$ is basically $$ USLE_i $$ minus the $$ C $$ and $$ P $$
       factors which represent the benefits of vegetation and good management
       practices.

   The watershed-level outputs of the model would also be updated to include
   this indicator as follows: remove "sed_retent" and add the sum of "Total
   Retention" per polygon and the sum of "Local Erosion Control" per polygon.
3. **Create new ecosystem service indicator output (raster) called “Avoided Erosion”**
   representing avoided erosion benefits to that pixel, from the perspective of
   soil loss:

   $$ AE_i = RKLS_i - USLE_i $$

   note (in the User Guide) that $$ R_i $$ ($$ T_i $$ in the new nomenclature)
   could be added separately if trapping of sediment originating upslope could
   mitigate erosion on a downslope pixel (e.g., if high quality soil is eroded
   from upslope)
4. **Drop 2 legacy sediment retention indices currently included in the model**
   Described in the section "Legacy" in the user's guide.
5. **Updates to User Guide (can happen separately from the code changes requested above):**
   * Update the User Guide to reflect changes in equations 78 and 79 (and
     associated, more explanatory, text)
   * Add use cases to the User Guide for applying different outputs
   * Add a figure showing conceptually what the different variables in the
     model are and how they relate to a toy landscape and which variables
     are output as the retention indicators given above.

## Open Issues

There is an additional issue with the LS factor, which James will address
separately. The current LS factor values are very high compared to what is
obtained from other software, e.g., SAGA. The SAGA LS factor also results in
more realistic results when compared to sediment observations.
